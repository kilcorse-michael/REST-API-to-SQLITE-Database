# Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree v2 - REST API Project

This is the completed Unit 9 Project. I am going for exceeds. Most difficult part was breaking away from the cli and building the model files and directories by hand due to the fact that the cli produces deprecated code.

Run ```npm install``` to download the dependencies and then ```npm start``` to start the server!

Server is set to URL: [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).
